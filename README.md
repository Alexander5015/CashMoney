I/O Hackathon

A problem we have right now is there is no knowledge of amount of people at the services since no one is using the app.

How to run:
1. run server.py
2. run gui.py

How to use: 
- Hovering over an location will display the safety of the place ( since there is no entries, it shows 'no entry' ).
- Clicking on a location will bring you to a screen to do a poll, submitting it will upload the information onto a 'database'.
- Then the safety of the location will update accordingly.


Dependencies required to run the program:
Running on python 3.7;
statistics, asyncio, pyqt5, json, time, aiosqlite, math
